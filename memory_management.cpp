/*
Memory Management:
C/C++ Programs are provided with different types of memory areas.
* Stack -> Allocated automatically for local variable.
* data section -> allocated for global and static data.
* heap -> allocated at runtime.
* All memory is taken from the process address space.
* C/C++ programms support for memory allocation at run-time(dynamic).
* Allocation on the heap has to be managed by the programmer.
* Stack and data section allocations are managed by the runtime.

Dynamic Momeory Allocation in C.
* malloc : allocate raw memory on the heap.
* calloc : allocate memory on the heap and initializes it to zero.
* realloc : allocates larger chunk of memory for an existing allocation.
* free : deallocates / releases the momory allocated through the above functions.
*malloc:
	The malloc is used to allocate a block of memory dynamically.
	It comes from the C standard library and is included via the <cstdlib> header.
	void* malloc(size_t size); -> size: The number of bytes to allocate.
	On success, malloc returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.
	If the allocation fails, it returns NULL.

The calloc used to allocate memory for an array of elements and initialize all bytes to zero.
It is part of the C standard library and can be included via the <cstdlib> header.

Function: void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
* num: The number of elements to allocate.
* size: The size of each element in bytes
* On success, calloc returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.Else it returns NULL.
* Zero Initialization: Unlike malloc, calloc initializes the allocated memory to zero.
* Casting: The void* returned by calloc needs to be cast to the appropriate pointer type.
* Freeing Memory: Always use free to deallocate the memory allocated by calloc to avoid memory leaks.

/*
Effective memory management is crucial for writing robust, efficient, and leak-free applications, especially in languages like C++ that give you
direct control over memory. Here are some best practices for memory management:
ðŸ”¹ 1. Use Smart Pointers
Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers:

std::unique_ptr: for sole ownership.
std::shared_ptr: for shared ownership.
std::weak_ptr: to break circular references in shared ownership.
These automatically manage memory and reduce the risk of leaks.
ðŸ”¹ 2. Avoid Manual new and delete
Use smart pointers or container classes (like std::vector, std::string) instead of manually allocating and deallocating memory.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Break Circular References
As discussed earlier, use std::weak_ptr to break cycles in std::shared_ptr graphs.
ðŸ”¹ 4. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
Encapsulate resource management in objects whose lifetimes are tied to scope:
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a fundamental C++ programming idiom that ensures resource safety by tying the lifetime of 
a resource (like memory, file handles, sockets, etc.) to the lifetime of an object.

ðŸ”‘ Key Idea:
When an object is created, it acquires a resource in its constructor, and when the object goes out of scope, its destructor 
releases the resource automatically.
Prevents resource leaks
Simplifies exception safety
Makes code cleaner and more maintainable

    int* data;

public:
    // Constructor acquires the resource
    ScopedArray(size_t n) : size(n) {

    }

    // Destructor releases the resource
    ~ScopedArray() {
        delete[] data;

    int& operator[](size_t indexrn data[index];

    // No need to manually delete the array
    // Destructor will be called automatically
}

/*
Constructor acquires the resource (new int[n])
Destructor releases it (delete[])
Copying is disabled to prevent accidental double deletion
Move semantics are supported for safe transfers
Would you like a RAII example for something more advanced, like file handles, mutex locks, or sockets?

C++
std::ifstream file("data.txt"); // Automatically closes when out of scope
ðŸ”¹ 5. Use Containers Wisely
Standard containers like std::vector, std::map, and std::list manage memory internally and are safer than raw arrays or manual memory management.
ðŸ”¹ 6. Avoid Memory Leaks
Use tools like:
Valgrind (Linux)
Visual Studio Diagnostics Tools
AddressSanitizer
These help detect leaks and invalid memory access.
ðŸ”¹ 7. Minimize Heap Allocations
Prefer stack allocation when possible. Heap allocations are slower and more error-prone.

/*
ðŸ”¹ 8. Be Mindful of Object Lifetimes
Ensure that objects are not accessed after they are destroyed. This is especially important when using raw pointers or references.
ðŸ”¹ 9. Use Move Semantics
Use std::move to transfer ownership efficiently and avoid unnecessary copies.
ðŸ”¹ 10. Initialize All Variables
Uninitialized memory can lead to undefined behavior. Always initialize variables, especially pointers.
